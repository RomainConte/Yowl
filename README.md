# Yowl - WildHub

## Description

Yowl is a social network developed as part of a school project named **WildHub**. It allows users to connect, register, view other's posts, create their own posts, customize their profile (banner, profile picture, username, biography), follow other users, see their followers, and like and comment on posts.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using Flutter for the front-end, which allowed us to have a mobile application, and Strapi for the back-end, which is a headless CMS that enabled us to manage our database through the API it provides.

## Configuration and Installation

### Flutter

To launch the Flutter project:

1. Make sure you have Flutter and Dart SDKs installed on your machine.
2. Open the folder named `yowl` with your preferred IDE.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - For Flutter: `flutter pub get`
4. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

### Strapi

To configure and launch the Strapi server:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - For NPM: `npm install`
   - For Yarn: `yarn install`
3. Launch the Strapi server in development mode:
   - For NPM: `npm run strapi dev`
   - For Yarn: `yarn strapi dev`

## Usage

After launching the Flutter application and Strapi server, you can navigate through the app as you wish. For first-time use, creating a personal account will be necessary. The password is encrypted before being sent to the server for enhanced security.
